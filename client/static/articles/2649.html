		<p> When you become involved in the community beyond the campus, you become engaged in a partnership. Successful partnerships occur when there is a balance between your “service” and your “learning”. Communities should not be used as laboratories for your research when there is no community benefit. Neither should you perceive of yourself as “rescuing” a community without acknowledging its innate strengths. In other words, effective campus-community is:
			<ul>
				<li>Reciprocal in nature</li>
				<li>Mutually beneficial</li>
			</ul>
