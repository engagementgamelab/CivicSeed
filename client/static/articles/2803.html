			Tufts host communities are Medford, Somerville, Chinatown (a neighborhood of the City of Boston) and Grafton.   Medford and Somerville are home to the undergraduate Arts, Science and Engineering campus; School of Engineering, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and The Fletcher School.  Chinatown is the location of Tufts health sciences graduate schools including the School of Medicine, the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy, the School of Dental Medicine, and the  Sackler School of Biomedical Sciences.

			Even though this game does not include Grafton, Grafton is home to the Tufts Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine. Since it is approximately an hour from the Medford/Somerville and Boston campuses to Grafton, there is not much travel possible. Cummings students provide service to Grafton and its surrounding communities that include Worcester.
