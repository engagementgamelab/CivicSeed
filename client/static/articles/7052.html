		<p>The concept of "host communities" recognizes that the past histories and future well-being of the university and the neighborhoods in which it resides are strongly intertwined.   Students reside in local neighborhoods, use municipal services, and at times can cause disruption.  Although they use municipal services, universities do not pay taxes to the community.* There may be significant differences in the socioeconomic or racial background of the average student and the average community resident.  The university may have resources that could be valuable to individuals, organizations, and city government.  Neighborhood residents may be a significant proportion of university's workforce.   Directing the major focus of community service learning to host communities is thought to be  good practice and serves to strengthen important relationships.
