			Safety: As on any college campus and any urban community, paying attention to safety is important. Although you are entering communities with the best of intentions, students come from all parts of the U.S. and the world, with differing experiences with safety. Here are a few basic guidelines:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Use common sense</b>: Whether one is traveling locally or internationally, always be aware of your environment and avoid situations that may jeopardize your safety such as traveling alone, at night, or in unfamiliar areas.</li>
			<li><b>Be aware of the safety of others</b>: Whether you are a group leader or participant, you may be placed in the role of looking after others. Be aware of this responsibility as a developing leader and place safety first.</li>
			<li><b>Be prepared</b>: Learn the safety precautions and regulations of your site. It is recommended that you know how and where to call for help or assistance when needed. The Tufts Public Safety emergency number is 617-627-6911.</li>
			<li><b>Working with Minors</b>: All students working with minor children must read  the  “Tufts University Code of Conduct Involving Interactions with Minors” and complete the “Statement of Acknowledgement”.</li>
			<li>Please check with a Tufts staff member, your professor (if this is connected to a course), or your program leader if you have not been provided with this <a href='http://hr.tufts.edu/wp-content/uploads/EMP_General_Code_of_Conduct_Minors.pdf'>important document</a target='_blank'>. (link provided below, will open in a new window).</li>
		</ul>
