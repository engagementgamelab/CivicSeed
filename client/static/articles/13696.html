		<h2>Reflection</h2>
		<p>
			In order to perform effective community work, one must engage in reflection before, during, and after engagement either individually or as a group. John Dewey, a noted psychologist, education reformer, and philosopher stated, <em>“We do not learn from experience…we learn from reflecting on experience.”</em>
		</p>

			What do we mean by reflection? There are many definitions, but basically reflection is the means by which we take an experience (in this case, civic engagement or community service) and through thinking about it and discussing it with others we make connections that transform it into learning.
		</p>
		<p>Reflection helps individuals gain a deeper awareness of self and society by providing an outlet to assess their impact, evaluate their projects, and work through challenges. Since many campus members enter the community through classes and/or organizations, group reflection is important. Establishing safe spaces for group reflection builds a supportive community of passionate members who learn from each other and help each other process challenging experiences. If you are a leader of a student organization participating in community engagement, you should build time for reflection into your program.

			Reflection may take the form of journal writing (with someone responding to your journal entries), formal group discussions, or even conversations during travel time.
