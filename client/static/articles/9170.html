		<h2>Communities Through Asset-Based Model</h2>
		<p>
			Every community has both needs and assets. Often, students are used to the perspective that the communities they are serving are “disadvantaged” and have multiple needs, but it is important to learn that there are many resources present in a community. Whether organizations, schools, businesses, residents, service providers, or physical resources, students should be able to identify these assets and how they can be a part of their experience. In other words, Asset-Based Community Development is an approach to community based on the principles of:   Appreciating and mobilizing individual and community talents, skills and assets (rather than focusing on problems and needs). Community-driven development rather than development driven by external agencies or individuals.   
		</p>

		<p>
			In contrast, a "needs-based" approach is the traditional community service model where student develop a program that primarily focuses on the needs and challenges of a particular community. Seen as a "top to bottom" or "outside-in" approach, need-based service is more difficult to sustain because of its major focus on the deficits of the organization.

			With an asset-based approach, you are able [to] enhance the community's mission and produce a strong and long-lasting partnership because you are working with the pre-existing resources and skills of the organization.
