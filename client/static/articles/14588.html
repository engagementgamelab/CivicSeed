			As a college student working in collaboration with community members, it is important to remember the concept of community partnership discussed  in Part 2:  <b>An effective partnership is mutually beneficial</b>. Keep this is mind as you move through your project.

			You were told in Level 1 that in Level 3 you would learn about combining the goals and outcomes you have set for yourself as a student with the goals and desired outcomes of the community organization. Personal goals benefit you; project goals benefit the community. When these two perspectives are both understood and combined, a foundation is set for a mutually beneficial partnership.
