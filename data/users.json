In an object-oriented approach, objects are viewed as little worlds of their own, and the outside world may touch them only through a limited and well-defined interface, a number of specific methods and properties. The 'reached list' we used at the end of chapter 7 is an example of this: We used only three functions, makeReachedList, storeReached, and findReached to interact with it. These three functions form an interface for such objects."

            "Personally, I have a hard time tearing myself away from such maps, particularly those showing the Bay Area, where I live. The simplified designs recalling Harry Beck’s 1933 London Underground map are, in my opinion, beautiful. And ever since I sold my car last year, I’ve been reliant on walking, biking, and public transit, so a fantasy transit map gets my head spinning with ideas. I could go directly from my house in Oakland to Golden Gate Park in San Francisco on a sunny day. Or maybe I’d go on a wine tour in Napa and drunkenly ride BART back. In this gallery, I’ve collected a few transit map examples that might inspire your own fantasies."

            "New Orleans spent decades paving over swampland to bring its people into the 20th century. But as the fallout from Hurricane Katrina made clear, the very infrastructure that modernized the city works against it when disaster strikes. That’s why local architects and advocates have put forth the Greater New Orleans Urban Water Plan, a $6.2 billion effort to give city a 21st-century water management strategy that borrows from, for instance, the Dutch. Reporter Sarah Goodyear asks whether rain gardens, detention ponds, bioswales, porous pavement and the like represent the way forward for a perennially cash-strapped and tradition-bound New Orleans."

So far, we have used objects as loose aggregations of values, adding and altering their properties whenever we saw fit. In an object-oriented approach, objects are viewed as little worlds of their own, and the outside world may touch them only through a limited and well-defined interface, a number of specific methods and properties. The 'reached list' we used at the end of chapter 7 is an example of this: We used only three functions, makeReachedList, storeReached, and findReached to interact with it. These three functions form an interface for such objects."

            "As the name suggests, object-oriented programming is related to objects. So far, we have used objects as loose aggregations of values, adding and altering their properties whenever we saw fit. In an object-oriented approach, objects are viewed as little worlds of their own, and the outside world may touch them only through a limited and well-defined interface, a number of specific methods and properties. The 'reached list' we used at the end of chapter 7 is an example of this: We used only three functions, makeReachedList, storeReached, and findReached to interact with it. These three functions form an interface for such objects."

But the stakes are particularly high with transit, because the alternative – taking the car – requires no wait at all."

The simplified designs recalling Harry Beck’s 1933 London Underground map are, in my opinion, beautiful. And ever since I sold my car last year, I’ve been reliant on walking, biking, and public transit, so a fantasy transit map gets my head spinning with ideas. I could go directly from my house in Oakland to Golden Gate Park in San Francisco on a sunny day. Or maybe I’d go on a wine tour in Napa and drunkenly ride BART back. In this gallery, I’ve collected a few transit map examples that might inspire your own fantasies."
